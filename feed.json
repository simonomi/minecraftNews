<:bao_icon_graphics:1187474298735186010> OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements<br>**Developer’s Note**: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirements has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.<br>### Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities<br>- <:PiggoBug:710091809975435295> Fixed a bug where breaking a Shelf while another player is interacting with it could lead to visual bugs in the player inventory<br>- <a:copper_golem_dance:1405460033235456030> Copper Golems hitbox has been tweaked<br>  - The hitbox is now 0.49 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through narrow spaces<br>- <:copper_door:1194275547925200956> Copper Golems can now open doors<br>- 🧪 Test Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads<br>- 💡 Ambient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the game<br>  - The underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction<br>### Game Mode Switching<br>- 🪽 Switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode no longer causes the player to stop flying<br>  - Instead, flight now only gets disabled when switching game modes if the player is near the ground<br>    - A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats...) within 1 block below them<br>  - Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity<br>    - This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground<br>**Developer's Note**: This change is a partial revert of a bugfix from a previous snapshot. Even though the old behavior prior to the fix was unintended, the approach we took to fixing flight didn't quite **land** the way we wanted it to. In response to community feedback, we're trying this new approach as a less disruptive alternative.<br>### Game Rules<br>- <:command_block:1135755838968045608> Added `spawnerBlocksEnabled` game rule controlling if Spawner Blocks should be enabled or not<br>  - Defaults to `true`<br>### Mob Spawning<br>- Logic for choosing type of equipment for mobs spawning with equipment has been tweaked to add Copper as a possibility<br>  - The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between Leather, Copper and Gold<br>  - The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87%<br>### Sounds<br>- 🔊 Some sound sliders in the Music & Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world<br>### UI<br>- The Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box<br>## Technical Changes<br>- <:pack_icon:984997615160684594> The Data Pack version is now 87.0<br>- <:pack_icon:984997615160684594> The Resource Pack version is now 69.0<br>- <a:WumpusKeyboardSlam:611351873659600928>  Some previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players<br>## Bugs Fixed<br>- <:PiggoBug:710091809975435295> Parity issue: Adjusting slider in the sound settings when not being in a world does not play a sound of that category<br>- <:PiggoBug:710091809975435295> \/locate doesn't work outside build limit<br>- <:PiggoBug:710091809975435295> Interactive collision check path is broken<br>- <:PiggoBug:710091809975435295> Copper golems remain completely stationary while searching chests, causing them to float and making them unable to receive knockback or be pushed<br>- <:PiggoBug:710091809975435295> Copper golems can interact with chests diagonally through solid blocks<br><br>...And many more!<br>Join the official feedback discord server and discuss these changes here: https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/1138536747932864532\/1414974645060243629<br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/minecraftfeedback","title":"Snapshot 25w37a","url":"https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/en-us\/article\/minecraft-snapshot-25w37a","id":"Snapshot 25w37a","date_published":"2025-09-09T19:44:09Z"},{"content_text":"# Beta\/Preview 1.21.120.22<br>-# https:\/\/feedback.minecraft.net\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/39606021304589-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-120-22<br>**NOTE**: While we roll out the GDK update on Minecraft Preview for Windows, some players will remain on Preview version 1.21.120.20.
